I deleted it from the phone but I could not find a better app than this so I downloaded it only,Improve app search functionality
Who will pay for this app just for personal nutrition. Ask chatgpt they are suggesting the verity of options. There guys does not having anything.,Enhance app value proposition
I hope,No specific improvement suggestion
"I can't see images after the video you put on the 3-4th slide, it doesn't just move, I can't understand how things will look, especially something that needs to be worn. It's very disturbing; this feature is really pissing me off, I had to return things because those don't fit well, because I couldn't see the preview. Please work on it. Also, packaging has improved for Flipkart over time, but would love to see further progress, instead of plastic tapes/packets, use something else.","Improve the product preview feature to ensure that users can see images clearly, especially for items that need to be worn. Enhance the user experience by making sure the images are visible. Continue working on sustainable packaging alternatives to reduce the use of plastic tapes/packets for a more eco-friendly approach."
"Even if we connect it to a wifi of high speed it takes forever to load and show the result. It is really very frustrating to wait for it to load every time we change the screen. I request you to kindly look into this matter and fix this issue and if it is fixed it is an excellent app. However, this issue makes it the worst until it is fixed.","Address the slow loading issue, especially when connected to high-speed Wi-Fi, to provide a smoother and faster user experience. Improve the app's responsiveness to eliminate frustrating waiting times. Once resolved, it has the potential to become an excellent app."
"Questionable UX choices. I know you have new features on left/right swipe, don't shove them in my face when I'm looking for something on my current tab. Instead show me that I can swipe, but without cutting any content on my main focus page. Plus, once I've seen the hint, do not show it to me ever again, it's super irritating and makes me want to go to Amazon's dated but less irritating UI.","Refine the user experience by introducing hints about new features like left/right swipe in a non-intrusive manner. Avoid disrupting the user's current task. Once the hint is seen, do not repeatedly display it to prevent user irritation and provide a more seamless experience."
"Flipkart is my primary shopping app. The customer support, delivery experience, and quality of products, everything has been good for so long. But since a few days, there has been a compromise in the quality of the products. Also, some of the products now have 3 days return period which is quite inconvenient. Also, there has been a frequent mix-up of the products. I have received different products from what I ordered THRICE this year. It's a good platform but these things need to be improved.","Maintain the quality standards that made Flipkart your primary shopping app, and address the compromise in product quality. Reconsider the 3 days return period and make it more convenient for users. Take measures to reduce product mix-ups and ensure customers receive what they ordered for a more consistent and reliable shopping experience."
"The most fraudulent service I have ever seen. If the item is paid as Cash on Delivery that time it may reach. But if paid earlier, then getting that item is not possible. I had the worst experience on that. I ordered an item, shared 3 contact no.'s. But without contacting any of those 3, the item showed as delivered. 4 times I raised complaints, but all were fruitless. Within 1 or 2 days, the issue will show as resolved without contacting. My opinion, either quit this rubbish app else only COD.","Address the issues related to non-delivery of items paid for in advance. Improve the communication and tracking systems to ensure a more reliable delivery experience. Investigate and resolve the concerns raised by customers who have experienced delivery issues, and maintain trust in the app. Consider reinstating the Cash on Delivery (COD) option if it provides a more secure delivery process for users."
"Every time it says it can't ship to my pin code almost all the time. It is so annoying! And I have placed an order for a mobile, and the delivery date kept on delaying and got canceled the second time. During the Big Billion Days sale, the same thing is repeating; the delivery date has been changed twice, and the second time it doesn't even give any update. Disgusting app, I just want to uninstall it after I receive my products or just cancel all the orders!!!!","Improve the service availability to more pin codes to prevent the annoyance of customers who face shipping limitations. Enhance the reliability of delivery timeframes and provide more consistent updates, especially during high-demand sale events. Ensure that users can enjoy a seamless shopping experience without interruptions like delayed deliveries or last-minute cancellations."
Reducing one star as over the past few there seems to be a bug in the product page and hasn't been resolved yet. I can't scroll the product images after the 3rd image even if there are 9 or 10 images and videos. I tried magnifying the product and then scrolling still no use. Hope you guys fix it. Love the new features but if the base functionalities don't work then that's an issue.,Address the bug in the product page that prevents users from scrolling through all product images. Ensure that the basic functionalities work seamlessly as they are crucial to user experience. Continuously work on improving the app's features to maintain a high level of user satisfaction.
"The Flipkart app's delivery service left me incredibly disappointed. My order was delayed without any clear communication, and when it arrived, the packaging was in terrible condition, leading to a damaged product. Trying to resolve the issue was even worse – their customer support was unhelpful and seemed indifferent to my concerns. Dealing with them was a frustrating experience, and I won't be using their app again.",Improve the delivery service by providing clear communication and timely deliveries to prevent customer disappointment. Focus on enhancing packaging to ensure products arrive undamaged. Train the customer support team to be more helpful and attentive to customer concerns. Enhance the overall experience to retain and attract more users.
"Edit: Recently they've added Rs 10 for orders that are available in great offers claiming as 'one-time sale fee.' It's almost the same amount which we are using super coins to reduce the final amount. This seems unnecessary and is there for almost all items I've ordered recently. Disappointed. Old review: I've ordered almost 10 items from Flipkart at a stretch, and I'm Happy with my shopping with Flipkart. .delivery done as promised! and easy returns or replacements and value for money!",Reconsider the additional fee for orders and ensure it aligns with the users' expectations. Be transparent about such charges. Focus on providing value for money and delivering on promises to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction. Continue offering easy returns and replacements as part of a positive shopping experience.
"I never thought I would give 1 rating for this app because it is the only online shopping I was using, and I'm a plus member, but from the last one week, all the products are showing as non-deliverable for my location, and I'm really not sure what's the issue. If it is one or two products, I can understand that it's a seller not delivering, but all the products are showing non-deliverable. I think I'm gonna completely uninstall this app because there is no use of keeping it when they can't deliver things.",Investigate and resolve the issue of products showing as non-deliverable for specific locations to prevent the inconvenience for users. Ensure that delivery options are available to maintain the app's usefulness for customers and retain their loyalty.
"I have been buying books from this app since years. Recently I ordered a book worth 1832 INR on this app. Not only did they take a hell lot of time to deliver (more than 10 days) but also they gave me some cheap small book instead of the one I ordered. When I filed a return and refund, they say that they take 3 working days just for someone to pick up the wrong product delivered to me. To add to that, I must fall within their rigid return policy. They wouldn't paid me for the lost time even.","Enhance the book delivery service by reducing delivery times and ensuring accurate orders. Speed up the return and refund process to prevent customer inconvenience. Consider being more flexible with the return policy, and provide compensation for the time and inconvenience caused by errors on the app."
"Placed an order on 1 October, and I was supposed to get my item on 11th. On the day of delivery, the app decided to cancel my order by itself. When I tried to call the delivery agent, someone else picked up. Flipkart didn't even provide you with the right phone number of the delivery agent. The experience was so bad, you are better off walking to the store and buying it from there.",Prevent the automatic cancellation of orders and ensure that users receive their items as scheduled. Provide accurate and reliable contact information for delivery agents to improve the customer experience. Focus on consistency and reliability to keep users engaged with the app.
"Fraudulent marketing. They hide one or two digits from the real price while showing in the app, after adding to cart, the price will be at least 10 times of what you expected. Be very careful before you pay. Refund process is not reliable. If they give you a gift card, the card is not usable. You can just see a card in the app. You cannot use it.",Ensure transparent pricing and accurate representation of product prices to build trust with users. Address any discrepancies between displayed and final prices. Improve the reliability of the refund process to minimize inconveniences for customers. Make gift cards usable to enhance user satisfaction and trust.
"The app is having a lot of issues these past few months. I have been using Flipkart for years but the amount of issues that I faced in these months are more than that of the past years. Also for every product it shows not deliverable, and some products are not delivered on the promised time. This issue is from the past 2-3 months.",Identify and resolve the various issues plaguing the app to ensure a smoother user experience. Address the problem of products showing as non-deliverable and ensure that products are delivered within the promised timeframes. Maintain the reliability and consistency that users have come to expect from the app.
"I'm extremely disappointed with the delivery service from Flipkart. My order was scheduled for delivery twice, but both times it was not delivered. The lack of effective communication and support from their customer service only added to my frustration. It's essential for a company to provide reliable delivery and responsive customer service, and Flipkart has fallen short in both aspects. I hope they take immediate steps to rectify these issues. Wish I could give less than 1 star",Prioritize improvements in the delivery service to ensure timely and reliable deliveries. Strengthen communication channels to provide users with updates and address issues effectively. Train customer service representatives to be more responsive and helpful. Focus on delivering an overall better customer experience and work towards regaining the trust of users.
"All features are good except the chat feature to deal with any orders. When by mistake if I click on 'cancel my order,' without even the double confirmation, the chatbot directly cancels my order!! Very bad Flipkart... I have lost 2k discount offer because of this mistaken cancellation. I immediately called the customer care number as well; they mentioned that the refund is already processed within just 2 minutes... Please ask for double confirmation before the cancellation of any order 🙏",Enhance the user experience related to order cancellation by adding double confirmation to prevent accidental cancellations. This would avoid situations where customers lose out on discount offers. Ensure a smoother interaction with the chatbot for order-related tasks to improve the user experience.
"The app is having too many issues lately. Products are shown as non-deliverable even if they are usually delivered to my location. The app frequently crashes, and I have trouble finding and ordering products. Flipkart needs to work on their app's stability and usability to keep customers loyal.",Address the issues with products showing as non-deliverable when they can typically be delivered to a location. Focus on improving the app's stability and performance to prevent crashes and make it easier for users to find and order products. Maintain customer loyalty by providing a seamless shopping experience.
"All features are good except the chat feature to deal with any orders. When by mistake if I click on ""cancel my order"", without even the double confirmation, the chatbot directly cancels my order!! Very bad Flipkart.... I have lost a 2k discount offer because of this mistaken cancellation. I immediately called the customer care number as well, they mentioned that the refund is already processed within just 2 mins.... Please ask for double confirmation before the cancellation of any order 🙏",Improve the chat feature to add double confirmation before order cancellation to prevent accidental cancellations. Consider refunding the discount offer lost due to the mistake. Enhance customer support responsiveness to avoid further inconveniences for users. Make sure the user experience aligns with user expectations and promotes trust in the app's features.
App is having a lot of issues recently. Some features are not stable. Price shown is varying on clicking on the product. Delivery also getting delayed these times. There were no wide range of products compared to earlier.,"Address the recent stability issues in the app to provide a more consistent user experience. Ensure that product prices are accurate and do not vary unexpectedly. Improve the delivery process to avoid delays. Consider expanding the range of products to offer a wider selection, similar to what users experienced earlier. Maintain reliability and consistency to keep users satisfied."
"There is no control of Flipkart on their registered sellers. Recently, I have placed an order, but at the time of delivery, the seller canceled my order. I was eagerly waiting for my order, but because of the pathetic services given by Flipkart, I'm really disappointed. I will never recommend anyone to shop on Flipkart. Local vendors are better than Flipkart.",Establish better control and oversight of registered sellers to prevent situations where orders are canceled without adequate reason. Improve communication and coordination between Flipkart and its sellers to avoid customer disappointments. Ensure that the delivery process is reliable and that customers receive their orders as expected. Work on providing a better shopping experience to regain trust and loyalty.
"It's the worst shopping application ever. Regularly, I pay the pay-later money, only for one month, I have some issue, so that I was paying the bill a little bit late. But Flipkart now blocked the pay-later option for my account. And it's not showing the product cancel option. It's too cheap and mean.. Shame on you, Flipkart.",Address the issue of the blocked pay-later option to provide users with more flexibility in payment. Ensure that users can access the product cancel option when needed. Improve communication with users to resolve payment issues and prevent blocking accounts without sufficient reason. Promote transparency and accountability to maintain user trust.
"I don't know why in my orders you were showing ""Order Not Placed."" If I placed an order, if it's successful, then only you should show it in my orders. Sometimes if I try to check the total price and offer and get back, it still shows in my orders. Earlier, it was not like this; if I placed an order or canceled, then Flipkart was showing it in my orders. Sometimes it is irritating to see the red line ""Order Not Placed"" for this product. Remove this feature from the app. Other than this app is really good.",Ensure accurate order status representation to avoid confusing users. Prevent the display of 'Order Not Placed' for successful orders. Remove this feature from the app as it is causing irritation. Focus on offering a seamless user experience and maintain consistency in showing order status.
"Tonight on this platform I was about to make a big purchase. It has an extra discount using super coins. But I couldn't use it no matter how hard I tried. I even tried calling customer care, but they couldn't help either. I didn't make the purchase because the supercoin discount was a deal-breaker. What's the point of having such an important feature if you won't let us use it? Anyways, thank you, Flipkart, for helping me save money 💰🙏","Ensure that users can successfully utilize extra discounts, such as those involving super coins, during their purchases. Improve customer support's ability to assist users with issues related to discounts. Make sure that such essential features work as expected to provide the best value for users. Continue helping users save money and appreciate their loyalty."
"Worst experience with Flipkart. I've been using the app for the past few years, but these days they are accepting the order and deducting the amount from my account without delivering the product. After a few days, they cancel the orders without any prior notification. They don't even provide hub details for direct communication with the hub members.",Improve order processing and communication. Notify customers about order cancellations and provide hub details for direct communication. Enhance the reliability of the delivery process to prevent disappointments and inconveniences for users.
"Not a bad app. However, it shouldn't put a fine on its customers for returns. Instead, it should charge the developers or those who market their products for enhancing color and pattern. I received an open box delivery, which was not my choice. The app should notify me about open box deliveries and related details. Now I'm stuck with a bad product. 😡","Reevaluate the return policy and consider charging developers or product marketers for issues related to product color and pattern. Notify users about the type of delivery (e.g., open box) to manage user expectations. Ensure that users have a choice regarding the type of delivery they receive."
"The worst app I've ever experienced. The app doesn't work, and it's also problematic on a web browser. It lacks the provision to add a mobile number if the account is registered with an email ID, and vice versa. The app has an extremely poor refund policy with limited and ineffective options. It sends OTP for everything without allowing users to enter the OTP, leading to account lockouts. This app is the worst and seems illegitimate.",Address the technical issues with the app and make it functional on both the app and web browser. Provide users with the flexibility to associate their accounts with mobile numbers or email IDs as needed. Revise the refund policy to offer more effective and user-friendly options. Ensure a smooth OTP verification process that doesn't lead to account lockouts.
"Worst app for flight booking. It's been almost 7 months since I raised an issue, but there's been zero effort by the support team to resolve it. They have been unhelpful and failed to provide meaningful assistance. The experience has been frustrating and left me questioning the overall competence and dedication of the support staff.",Improve the functionality and reliability of the app for flight bookings. Enhance customer support responsiveness and efficiency. Ensure that raised issues are promptly addressed and resolved. Prioritize customer satisfaction and experience to rebuild trust and competence in the app.
"Disgusting. I would like to return the Realme Neckband 3 that I bought on October 8 because I'm not happy with the audio quality and the power on/off settings are confusing. However, Flipkart is not letting me return it. They are not ready to accept it back despite offering the return option. Flipkart, please do the needful to return such a poor-quality product.","Improve the return process for products with quality issues. Ensure that customers have the option to return items with legitimate concerns, such as poor audio quality. Make the return process more user-friendly to enhance customer satisfaction and trust."
"Very bad experience with Flipkart. I had a Flipkart Pay Later limit of 90,000, but I couldn't use it at all when I wanted to buy products for my sister's wedding. Not a single product accepted the Pay Later option. I contacted customer care twice, but they didn't resolve this issue. I'm very disappointed with the app. In contrast, Amazon offers the same Pay Later option perfectly. Thanks, Amazon. 💗",Ensure that the Flipkart Pay Later option works seamlessly for users with sufficient limits. Address technical issues that prevent the use of the Pay Later feature. Provide reliable customer support to resolve user concerns and disappointments. Compete with other platforms to maintain user loyalty and trust in the app.
"Loading time is very high in this app. Even with a good connection, it takes a long time, which is really frustrating. Today, I faced an issue in making the payment. The application has several bugs. Items added to the cart may sometimes not be ordered together. The 'Pay' button freezes after entering credit card/debit card details, making it impossible to make payments. The order history does not open sometimes. Yours sincerely, a frustrated Plus Customer.",Optimize the app's loading times and ensure it functions smoothly even with a good internet connection. Fix the payment issues and resolve bugs that affect the user experience. Guarantee that items added to the cart can be ordered together without problems. Ensure the 'Pay' button is responsive and does not freeze during payment. Provide a reliable and consistent order history to assist customers. Focus on enhancing the overall user experience to reduce user frustration.
"The app is having a lot of issues these past few months. I have been using Flipkart for years, but the number of issues I faced in recent months exceeds that of previous years. Additionally, for every product, it shows ""not deliverable,"" and this issue has persisted for the past 2-3 months.","Address and resolve the recent technical issues plaguing the app, making it slow and unresponsive. Ensure that all products are correctly marked as deliverable, as users have faced this issue for an extended period. Improve the overall app performance and reliability to meet user expectations."
"This is such a terrible experience with the Flipkart app. It has become too slow, unresponsive, and laggy. Moreover, I can't even edit my wishlist anymore. Every time I add a new product or delete anything from the wishlist, it reverts to its previous state. Meaning, no changes to the list. Deleted products reappear, and new additions don't get saved.","Optimize the app for speed and responsiveness. Fix the issues related to the lag and unresponsiveness. Ensure that users can edit their wishlists without any issues. New additions should be saved, and deleted items should stay removed. Enhance the app performance to provide a smooth and efficient experience for users."
"In this app, they mislead customers by showing fake offers that they never honor, and customer service response is very poor. I wish I could give a negative rating. Most of the time, items are missing in the delivered orders. Customers have to contact customer care, wasting 30 minutes, and then return the order, which they initially needed. The bigger headache is that the pickup person asks for the missing item in the order. Additionally, product reviews appear to be fake, and genuine reviews are not published.",Ensure transparency and honesty in displaying offers and discounts. Improve customer service response time and effectiveness. Implement strict quality control to prevent items from going missing in orders. Streamline the return process for customers and avoid inconvenience. Ensure that genuine customer reviews are published to enhance trust and credibility.
"One of the worst direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands in India, especially in terms of customer convenience and experience. On the other hand, their biggest competitor excels in customer satisfaction. I have been a customer since 2013, and every time I order, there is always an issue, either with delivery or the product itself. This company is a disappointment. I wish I could give a negative 5-star rating, but unfortunately, there is no option for that.",Significantly improve customer convenience and experience. Address the recurring issues with delivery and product quality. Benchmark the standards set by your competitor in terms of customer satisfaction. Strive to provide a seamless and issue-free shopping experience for your customers.
"Worst services by any e-commerce company. My last two orders were delayed for an extended period, and due to this, I had to cancel one of my orders. As of now, I am unable to track my second order, which was supposed to be delivered on 22nd September but still shows ""in transit."" I use multiple online shopping apps, but this has been the worst experience. I attempted to connect with customer support multiple times, but I did not receive a proper response.",Enhance your delivery services and ensure timely delivery to prevent customer inconvenience and order cancellations. Improve order tracking to provide customers with accurate updates. Strengthen your customer support team to provide effective assistance and resolution for customer queries. Strive to offer a better overall customer experience.
"The worst app ever. When I placed an order, I received confirmation of the order and the expected delivery time. However, after a few days, they canceled my order, citing that it is out of stock. Why didn't the app inform me about this in the first place? I attempted to speak with customer care, and they suggested ordering from another retailer. But now, the price has increased, and I cannot enjoy the original discount. This experience with customer care and the app has been terrible.",Ensure better inventory management to prevent situations where orders are canceled due to items being out of stock after confirmation. Improve communication to keep customers informed. Train customer support to provide more proactive assistance in such situations. Offer a seamless shopping experience and uphold discounts for customers to maintain satisfaction and trust.
"This is the worst experience I've had with Flipkart. I ordered a mobile and made the payment through a credit card. Now they have canceled my order without notice, citing a technical error. My question is, who will cover the bank interest amount and processing fees charged by the bank at the time of my order? This has cost me around Rs 1000. 😔😔😔😔",Provide better handling of technical errors to avoid order cancellations. Ensure that customers are informed of any issues promptly. Take responsibility for the bank interest amount and processing fees incurred by the customer due to order cancellations. Uphold customer trust and provide financial compensation where necessary to rectify errors.

"The best app out there for calorie tracking. The food database is huge and I hardly ever came across anything that wasn't available to track. What annoys me, however, is the constant notifications.

As someone who is just looking for basic self-tracking, it's very irritating to constantly swipe away the notifications to purchase the paid plan.",Reduce pushy notifications for paid plans
"Studio workouts are great, workout coaches and dietitian are well equipped with knowledge in their field.

Sometimes I find it quite confusing to navigate through the app. Apart from all this, all is good.",Simplify app functionalities and improve navigation
"Does well at tracking calories. Extremely pushy marketing tactics and nudges to upgrade. It takes anywhere between 5-10 taps to just start basic functionality and tracking. Very annoying to use, I wish they'd tone it down. I've complained to the customer service team a lot of times, but nothing. The user experience suffers because it makes it a chore to open the app to do anything.",Streamline user experience and reduce upgrade prompts
"Pathetic experience with ads. They're way too intrusive and almost make it useless. On one occasion, I had to disable a reminder to subscribe to a premium plan not once, not twice, but a freaking 3 times before I could actually get to what I wanted to do - a simple task of logging my meal. Gave it another chance after a couple of years, but it's too irritating for my taste. Bye for good.",Minimize intrusive ads and improve user experience
"Good app. I'm impressed with the variety of food available for calorie tracking. I felt only one drawback, they desperately push notifications every 30 minutes to track meals, water intake, exercise details, etc. It's honestly a bit too much. I had to switch off the notifications overall. Except for the pushiness when it comes to notifications, I recommend the app.",Reduce excessive notifications for tracking
"This used to be an amazing App earlier. It's now loaded with pop-ups and marketing material, even if you are a paid user. I have a smart plan, yet, got to navigate through multiple pop-ups before getting to the basic need of tracking. The user experience has deteriorated multiple folds in the recent times. There are many ways to upsell, killing the user experience is not one of them. I've lost interest in tracking even though I have paid for it.

"A year ago, I purchased their comprehensive plan and then discontinued it after a few weeks. I got the refund. I am now on the AI-powered Smart Plan.

It's a good app for anyone who wants to monitor and improve their food habits and physical activity. Just one complaint: No desktop or web app for those who prefer bigger screens and comfort.",Provide a desktop or web app for better user experience
"The app is great and well laid out in terms of UI and functionality aspect. I enjoy using it knowing it covers everything regarding health. I'd appreciate it further if there were a way to connect the Apple Watch data to it. Secondly, if I also have an iPhone where I do get notifications on the phone (for let's say about water reminders). Yet, having Apple Watch on me more than the phone itself, I'd like the option to get the notification for the same on the watch itself.

"Excellent app. Pros: 1. great workout plans. 2. great diet plan. 3. Great Studio experience. - It gives a wonderful balance between choosing strength and cardio or yoga, which many apps may not give. 4. Polite coaching system. Addresses coaching related queries promptly and up to their ability. Cons: 1. Toll-free number does not work for any technical issues. 2. Raising a concern or issue was also not working. 3. If you're slightly late for your studio workouts due to technical issues or just for joining late due to fast-paced tight schedules at work, beyond 5 minutes, you are prevented from entering, and this I personally feel is wrong. This is a serious issue and needs to be rectified. All users who have booked the session have to be allowed to enter the studio workout sessions irrespective of being late or not. 4. Scheduling a call is a wonderful system to let your coaches know when you will be free to receive their call. However, there are times when the coaches call you directly. I never minded it, however, there are other users who felt it to be annoying, as they might be in the middle of a class or some important meeting. I guess all calls must be mutually agreed upon. This system also needs pruning to make the users comfortable. After all, this is a great app but needs a lot of improvement.","Fix toll-free number and issue reporting, improve late entry policy for studio workouts, and refine scheduling system for coaching calls"
"A holistic app whose idea seems great. I wish to upgrade to a premium plan, but the lack of a trial bothers me. A 12-month subscription is too long to pay for without understanding the product. At the same time, a single month plan is comparatively very expensive. I wish they had a deeply discounted (if not free) trial plan for maybe 7 days so that I can try it before I buy it.",Introduce trial plans with shorter durations and discounted prices
"Used to love the app. But now it is way too aggressive in promoting the premium version. It would be fine if there was just one prompt every time I log in or one banner at one screen as it was earlier. But now it's very aggressive, even full-screen promotion! Multiple of those in succession! Just makes my experience horrible, I might just shift to some other app.",Reduce aggressive promotion of premium version

Thank you.",Simplify the interface and introduce longer-duration packages with discounts
"It is helping me. Unknowingly, we consume a bit of more calories. We don't know how much calories we have consumed and ends up in having more than required.

You can connect your app to the Google Fit. This gives all figures in a glance. Thanks to Healthify team.",Improve water intake goal tracking and integrate with Google Fit
"This is a great app. I absolutely love the 'insights' section of meals. It is a great way to know if you've had sufficient amount of everything like fiber and fat and carbs and proteins. I also love how Indian food is available in the database, which is often updated. But I'm not sure how much to rely upon the value parameters of those food items. A simple example which leads me to judging the correctness of the values is the difference between the nutrition values for 'Subway Salad' and the nutrition values if I enter individual elements of that salad separately. I would have loved it more if there was a separate section to just find out the details about a particular food item instead of having to check it by inserting it in one of my meals. Overall I am just an avid user of the application!",Enhance accuracy of nutrition values and provide a separate section for food item details
"I have been using this app to lose weight. I can keep track of everything like water consumption, steps, calorie intake and calories burned.

Also, I can't see calorie count of 'green tea', I hope they fix it.",Improve accuracy of calorie count for 'green tea'
"The features are very good and the app is practical no doubt. One suggestion I would like to make, instead of just providing with the information in macros provide the user with the amount of micro nutrients too. The other nutrients section does just that but it doesn't tell which food had that nutrient. It would be really helpful for people who have goals other than just gaining or losing weight.",Include micro nutrient information and specify the food sources in the 'other nutrients' section
Too many calls to upgrade. Very annoying. Plus it will take you a long time just to get into the app each time cause of too many pop ups (again asking you to upgrade) in between. Pathetic.

I wish to sincerely thank the team for making and maintaining such a useful app,Thank You for your positive feedback
"The app is connected to Google Fit and it has stopped syncing with Google since this morning. None of my workouts have been synced, and thus it cannot display the actual picture of my calorie intake and calorie burn. I literally have to manually input details of my workout. Every time I try to refresh the sync, it shows an error and says that the sync timed out. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed.",Fix sync issue with Google Fit
"Genuinely great app. Excellent database of food, and you can add a dish if it doesn't exist, which will be rare. Ease of adding, and the concept of adding individually to each meal is excellent. You can quickly add repeating dishes you eat by the options it shows. One thing is there is no way to enter my exact exercise level. The 4 levels given fall short of measuring my actual exercise level. Mine is between moderate and intense, as I actually do simple workouts and play. There is no way to enter it exactly.",Improve exercise level options for accurate tracking
"Extremely poor user experience, pushy ads every step of the way. Cannot move between screens without an ad.

For folks starting out, please don't use this.",Reduce the frequency of pushy ads and improve user experience
"Tracking experience is good, but every single time when I have to make an entry, there are pop-ups to buy premium or a diet or something else. It is very irritating.

The suggestions are very annoying.",Minimize pop-ups for premium purchases and improve tracking experience
"The app is user-friendly, and they have great customer service. However, you can avail the same using the free version. DO NOT UPGRADE TO ANY PLANS. NOT WORTH IT. My experience with the Transform plan has been very disappointing. 1. My Mentor was extremely impolite in her conversation with me. She misled me with the prices. Hence, didn't upgrade. 2. I had to chase my fitness coach to get a workout plan as it got monotonous over time. 3. You don't need a diet coach. Just the free app will do.",Improve customer service and address issues with paid plans
"I am using the free app since I'm not that regular in tracking my food. The app does exactly what it claims to do. It has a user-friendly interface, and the features work correctly.

It's a carefully created app. Kudos to the designers and developers!",Maintain user-friendly interface and consider weight gain diseases in tracking
"Best app of its kind in India. Helps in monitoring diet, setting weight goals, and helps during workouts too. Can sync with major wristbands and Google Fit. The problems I face are 1) Google Fit doesn't seem to sync perfectly. It often recognizes and inputs the wrong exercise from my Mi Band. 2) I often find it difficult to input the right quantity of food. Katoris, bowls, etc., are confusing. 3) The newsletters and health tips don't seem to be totally scientific.

This is highly annoying and needs to be fixed.",Resolve issues with accessing logs and improve app stability
"Horrible experience using this app. They claim to sync steps from Google Fit, but if there's an issue, there's no accountability from their end.

Highly disappointed with the overall experience. Uninstalling right now.",Address issues with step sync and improve transparency in events
"From an Indian perspective, this is the best CICO app. The best thing about it is the variety of Indian dishes which can be added easily with more than 90% accuracy in calories.

But it's understandable, as they have to run their business.",Reduce frequent pop-ups for premium packages
"This app is relentlessly invasive. If you're not paying them, they will constantly bug you to purchase plans.

"There is no easy way to track calories. I simply need a two-click workflow to track my calories, but I can't do that by simply scanning a barcode. Even to add custom food, I always have to search for it, and I am not able to add foods with barcodes. Also, stop pushing so much for the pro plan.

"I have been using this app since 2021, but lately, it is not working for me. They have fixed the calories to be consumed. The calorie consumption needs to vary as per the exercise you do. In my case, I burn a lot of active calories; however, the consumption in the app remains unchanged, leading to a very low consumption of food and landing me in a medical condition.

"The app is best for tracking daily calories. However, I have one suggestion to improve it further. Right now, a user can add food which is not there in the database, but it asks for the ingredients.

Please incorporate this feature in the app as early as possible.",Add the ability to directly add custom food with macro information
"While the calorie tracker is good, paid subscriptions are overpriced. You can confirm this overpricing by trying to look at their subscription costs where they first show you some amount for subscription and when you try to exit, they offer some discount of 31%.

"Would've been great if Googlefit could display the nutrition and other data from healthifyme. The USP of Healthifyme is the wide variety of Indian foods that are available for tracking so it makes sense for Indians to use it to count calories but my calories burnt from walking or exercising are logged into googlefit from other apps/devices. So, unless healthifyme can become like googlefit, it makes more sense to share calorie consumed and other data to googlefit. I'd pay for that.",Enable synchronization of nutrition and data with Google Fit

"Food tracking and reminders are pretty good. They lack in communication when I tried scheduling a call with a dietician. They do not call you at the right time and should wait for the call.

Hope they would improve on customer service.","Improve communication and customer service, especially for scheduling calls with dieticians"
"The basic plan is a joke. I wanted to test out the app before investing time and money in premium plans. So I opted for the basic diet plan. It's a waste.

"This is a fantastic app for anyone who wants to manage his health and particularly his weight. However, there is one problem that is annoying me very much.

Worst app ever. In this app they told you to buy premium to access the whole app but you can access all things without premium. So please don't buy premium. It is just a time and money waste.

I got the test done again and everything is normal. Just to save a little money, you may choose these people, but they're a scam and the tests are not proper. I met a doctor who told me the same. He's got so many patients worried about cancer but after taking the test again everything shows normal.",Improve test accuracy and reliability to avoid unnecessary stress and concerns

"Worst service I have ever seen. They told your report would be received in 48 hours, and then they told 72 hours. They also provide wrong information to customers, and the tests are also very costly. They provided me all the tests in 5400/- after discount, and the same test package is 5000/- without discount in the lab. Don't install the app. The one star is very big for this app. I am giving negative (-5/5).","Improve service quality, provide accurate information, and ensure competitive pricing"

The app is pretty bad and call center experience. The rescheduled tests don't get updated in the app. Prepaid order shown as cash on collection. What is even more weird is now I am getting messages for samples reaching the lab even though I have not given the sample yet. It is a pretty bad experience; these guys have barely managed to write an app that makes you frustrated.,"Resolve issues with app functionality, update rescheduled tests in the app, and ensure accurate order and payment details"
Very nice service. Thank you Healthians for quick service & report.,Appreciate the quick service and report from Healthians
Absolutely useless app and service. It takes a lot of time to get the report and there is no way to follow up. They have given a call back option but no one ever calls back. The 24*7 helpline is voice automated and just sends out a link which takes the user back to the app.,"Improve report delivery time, enhance follow-up options, and provide effective customer support"
"What a crappy app. While entering the address, under Colony, Street section it's redirecting to a blank page which shows powered by Google. And that section is star marked and marked as mandatory.

The customer service or so-called 'get in touch instantly' directs you to IVR and will not connect to anyone. There is no mode of getting in touch with them, and their help button doesn't help you in any way. I tried for an hour to reach them. I don't recommend this app.","Improve customer service, address issues with test bookings, and provide effective communication channels"

Have been using Healthians since a long time now. Booking process is seamless. Sample collection is always on time. Prices are very competitive. They show provisional results while testing is in process. Smart reports is a great feature where we can view and compare previous results with the current report! Everything is great about it!,"Appreciate the seamless booking process, on-time sample collection, competitive prices, and the smart report feature"
"One of the worst and nonsense service I had ever seen. Very pathetic response. Not serious about people's health. Communication only for bookings, not for post-booking. No proper response from executives. No one reached at my location for sample collection and no updates regarding this. While we are waiting, they said no service available at our location. Without any information, they gave the nonsense reason that no slot available.","Improve service quality, enhance communication, and ensure proper sample collection and updates"

"Third-grade service. I have booked for blood sample collection. But nobody has come up to collect it. When I looked into the app, it's showing that I haven't picked up the call, but the fact is that I already have a conversation with the sample collector, after that he switched off his phone. They are saying that they will give 24x7 hr service, but you will not get anyone when it requires. Worst customer service. They only deal with selling their products.",Improve sample collection service and address issues with customer support and communication
"Very very bad experience, worst service. I booked a sample collection appointment, and nobody came even after 2 hours. But their system was sending SMS that the sample collector is on his way since 2 hrs. When I called customer service, they gave the sample collector phone number, and it was switched off and no response.

"Excellent service. Booked a few tests for my mom. Right from the sample collection to test results, everything was hassle-free. Also, the packages are very reasonable. Would definitely recommend Healthians. But there seems to be some issue with the app. The price of the package was increasing when I was trying to book it. Later, I received a call from their support guys who booked the package for me over the phone. You guys need to look into it. Cheers guys. Keep up the good work.","Appreciate the excellent service, hassle-free experience, reasonable packages, and suggest addressing app pricing issue"
Really appalling to see how mismanaged things are when it comes to providing a basic check-up. Booked an appointment for the 15th April. Still nobody has come to pick up the sample. Nobody picks up at the customer support either thinking they might have to answer for their incompetence. Better to get yourself checked through other apps; I am sure they would know how to deal with their customers in a much better way.,"Address the mismanagement issues, improve customer support, and ensure efficient sample collection"
"Very very very poor service. Firstly, the app didn't work. I then called to book the appointment. The person who was supposed to come for sample collection didn't show up on time. Even after a lot of delay, he didn't receive my call. I called the company, but there also they kept putting the call on hold and even the person in charge of collection didn't receive a call from his supervisor. I think this company is a waste of time. I would suggest going with good reputable Labs in your area.","Improve the app functionality, address issues with sample collection, and enhance customer support"
"I have booked twice for blood tests, and the whole process is very easy and transparent. Sample collection is done hygienically and with utmost care.

"This may be the first time ever I had to go to the Play Store and rate with the minimum stars available. The service is extremely worst. I booked my screening test 2 days back of basic screening (699rs), and today they were supposed to come and collect my sample. However, no one showed up, and they canceled the booking.

"Very good and affordable blood test packages, free sample collection but not on time, accurate reports, free dietician and doctor consultation is really superb, but can't choose timing.

"Very bad experience. They took my blood sample two times in 2 days and still weren't able to generate a single complete report. Very unprofessional management. No proper customer support.

They will always claim that earlier sample not good and resampling required. Happened multiple times with me. Worst app. Nothing happens on doing the payment. No confirmation of the booking.

"App and the service is very good. But when I just checking for prices, y'all constantly call on the registered number.

THANK YOU.",Reduce unnecessary phone calls for price inquiries
Please don't trust the time promised by them also any kind of response once you have made the payment. They don't answer the calls from the registered phone & once paid. You have to call from a different phone No. and tell you want to book a new order within an one ring the will pick up and then when you ask about the previous order they disconnect the call. This is what is disappointing and trusting companies like this once the payment are done they don't care for what you go through.,Improve response time and customer support for paid orders
There is no point of scheduling the checkup on the app as they don't follow it. I selected the 7:30-8:30 slot and was then told that it would not be possible for collection on the day.

Don't recommend this experience to anyone.,Follow scheduled checkup timings and improve customer service

"Decent app. Easy to use and convenient to book a home appointment. However, they seem to be a bit careless. I booked some blood tests with them and the results came in time.

No complaint management system.","Improve sample collection reliability, enhance contact center communication, and establish a complaint management system"
"Booking gets auto-cancelled without any information because I didn't pay online. Even when the customer support said I can pay at the time of sample collection. And even on the day of sample collection, they said, the guy will come. On the next day, they said it got auto-cancelled as I didn't pay. Now I have to pay at the time of booking, but with this experience and seeing all those reviews, I can't trust them that they will get my test done even when I have paid in advance. Bad experience.","Resolve issues with auto-cancellation, improve payment flexibility, and build trust in the booking process"
"Worst service. Firstly, I called to book the appointment. The person who was supposed to come for sample collection didn't show up on time. Even after a day of delay, he didn't receive my call.

Since then I've made several calls to Healthians & they always assure me that someone would come but there's absolutely no communication from their end.

"It's actually Fraudians. In these hard times, where people are helping each other, they are making money. Their salespersons call you when you register for a test and ask you to pay beforehand. No one shows up, no details of the sample collector are shared. And you can't talk to anyone about it. Their customer care never picks up.

On 13May2023, I booked with another lab and the report showed HbA1c as 6.8 which is consistent with past Reports. I booked ticket no.4728507 with Healthians reporting this and followed up.

DO NOT USE.",Improve timely report delivery and customer support
"First overall experience with Healthians is very good. Booking, payment, discount through the App was fast and smooth. Booking details and payment confirmation were instantaneous.

"I was thoroughly satisfied with Healthians, not only the app but the service. The sample collection was very professional and on time, it was super smooth as the phlebotomist really knew how to painlessly collect the sample.

The best part is that they offered free doctor consultation who promptly called us and gave a direction on the next steps of the reports. The overall price they charged us was very reasonable.

Further, a quick comparison of deals would help us decide on the most appropriate package.

If you have not registered a test, they will be super fast in having a person talk to you. But once you have booked and paid, you can keep trying all day, no one is going to talk to you.

"Would have rated 5 stars till a few days back itself for the detailed style of reports. Option of smart report which is very good, and kits provided to the collector for sample collection. BUT...

Never ever try this app to book for friends and others. They will mess up your booking for sure. They will bug you for your friend's appointment and they don't call them directly. This is the worst.

However, I am not too sure about the accuracy of the test results. If there could have been some parameters to gauge this, I would have given a 5-star rating.",Provide parameters to gauge test result accuracy
"Most horrible, most unprofessional service ever! After taking the tests and processing the results, they realized they have forgotten to include two crucial tests specifically in the test package. It has been 13 days and I have still not received the results or hard copy of them. Very shady. I might as well go to an established lab and get my tests done.",Ensure all tests included in the package are conducted and improve result delivery time
"First interaction with Healthians was nice. Service-free home sample collection on time. Report and customer service were good. Thanks, Healthians!",Maintain prompt and quality service
"No user-friendly app. I was trying to book a test package for my mother, but the app is asking for a new email ID to add. It does not make any sense as to why a new email ID is needed. Also, when trying to add the address, it does not allow me to add the patient's location as it is different from where I am. Very bad app. At this age, your app developers should think better than this.",Improve user-friendliness of the app and address issues with email ID and address input
"Never use this app. By mistake, if you check the app even at 11 pm, they call and disturb you. They do not have basic sense. They call 10 times even if we ignore their calls.",Reduce the frequency of calls and respect users' preferences
"These guys will provide all fake information, and you will not get any help when you face the actual service provider. Do not get fooled by their free tests, services, etc...",Ensure accurate information and reliable services
Prompt service at an affordable price. Perhaps the cheapest when compared with its peers. It's awesome. The network further requires extension in rural areas also.,Expand network coverage to rural areas
"I wish there was a way to give less than 1 star. Even after 3 days of sample collection, reports are not available. Simple lipid profile test is taking so LONG? The customer support never picks up or answers your emails. Absolutely non-competent group of people. I want a refund immediately.",Improve report delivery time and customer support responsiveness
"I am using Healthians service for the last 3 years, and I am completely satisfied. I also randomly do these tests from other labs, and the results always tally. People giving low stars are the ones who compare home sample collection to a pizza delivery service, which is really stupid. There were instances when sample collectors were either rude, late, or impolite, but there were no single instances when they compromised safety, and I always found them to be masters of their profession.",Continue to prioritize safety and maintain service quality
"What is with the incessant calling? From 7 am onwards till now, I have received at least 8-9 calls as if I'm being hounded to do some investigations just because I opened this app! Being a doctor, I can say this hounding goes against medical ethics, and we would be better off without this app.",Reduce the frequency of promotional calls
"It's an extremely bad experience. The test descriptions do not match the test result outcomes. For example, their basic allergy screening package says that they'll tell you the allergen, but there is nothing like that mentioned in the report. It just gives a number for the measurement. Furthermore, when asked for support about it, they blatantly refuse, saying that they can't access the report and will connect to a doctor later. What's more, they'll spam you with telemarketing calls (2 calls/minute).","Ensure accurate test result descriptions, improve customer support, and reduce telemarketing calls"
I have used Healthians for a full body checkup three times so far. Great experience each time. The app and the service work very well and are in sync. I would recommend Healthians without hesitation. It is a reliable and efficient healthcare service provider.,Continue to provide reliable and efficient service
This is not only a software application but a complete functional package. It is too good to believe that such services exist in India. I came to know about Healthians from one of my friends. The package is complete in itself and has all services included that no other pathology test facility provides in India. From sample collection to explaining the test results and the free consultancy on what to do to improve your health is a welcome feature that no other lab provides. Go for it.,Maintain the comprehensive service package and continue to provide free consultancy
"No accuracy!! Do not trust the test results of Healthians. There are some serious issues in their findings. I have been using the Healthians app for 2 years. They have been constantly giving wrong test results in my TSH and HsCrp results, which were normal. I had checked the accuracy with 2 other service providers. Just to give you a snapshot, they gave my Thyroid TSH as 19, which was shocking to see. Thankfully, it's normal when I got it checked from the other 2 providers.",Ensure accuracy in test results
"2018: Good idea... very bad execution. Poor service. Once the customer has paid, they don't really care about service. It's been over a week, yet waiting for the reports. No response so far on the complaint raised. Adding a review as I got the test done again: 1. No way to contact; Tried the 'Call back' button on the app many times, but no one ever calls back. 2. Smart report not getting generated for one set of reports. 3. Tests done earlier are not visible on the app. Hence awful support system.","Improve customer support, responsiveness, and report visibility on the app"
Stop spamming! Just had a test again and received 3 calls in 30 minutes for a new test.,Reduce promotional calls and spamming
"Agent called and recommended that I upgrade to another health plan. However, the existing booking needed to be cancelled to do this. Why? The existing booking should be able to be edited for an upgrade. After Healthians cancelled my booking, I did not get a notification (email and SMS) to confirm right away. Why? This should be sent ASAP. Only after a cancellation message is sent indicating the refund details, should a new booking be created. Also, cancellation is not showing in the app, why?","Allow editing of existing bookings for upgrades, send immediate notifications for cancelled bookings, display cancellation details in the app"
Horrible experience and waste of money. I booked full body checkup through cult app. The sample pickup was fine until I got a call from healthians 2 days after the sample pickup that my urine sample was not in sufficient amount (funny because the bucket they send was filled) hence i will have to give same again. It's been 10 days since the second sample and i have received no report. Horrible experience and i wish I had not wasted money on this crappie app.,Address urine sample issue and provide timely reports
"I have booked blood test package through the app and 6 days have passed still I don't have complete report, I have given blood samples for three times, again they are asking for resampling as they rejected my sample. Earlier I used to book through Thyrocare and never they asked for resampling. If you're are booking through them, be ready to give blood samples for 3-4 times as they will reject it without proper explanation.",Improve sample collection and analysis process to avoid multiple resampling
"Most horrible company. 1. I booked a test, they should mention that they can perform it only if a particular scan is done. Which they didn't at the time of booking 2. Now they should cancel and automatically refund. But had to make several calls. First call, they said, I will receive the link to get refund (link doesn't work) 2nd call, they say you will receive an email in a week and you will get refund. No email received 3rd call after a week, no refund request was raised till now.","Improve communication about test requirements, automate cancellation and refund process"
Professional services. Really liked the sample collection process and the detailed reporting feature. The lab folks are experienced enough to take the sample without any hassle and with utmost ease.,Maintain professionalism in sample collection and improve reporting
"Tried to take their service after reading the reviews, but now after experiencing their service, feel all are paid reviews. I booked the service, sample collection was due at 11 am to 12 pm. No one turned up till 10 in night, even after posting Messages on their app. Trust me don't go for them, you will waste your time and if you want some urgent test for some critical illness then your precious time is wasted. Finally canceled the service and will Uninstall the app now. 0 stars 🌟",Address issues with sample collection and improve responsiveness
I had delay in my sample collection for about 3-4 hrs. And sample collection happened after I called customer support multiple times for those 3-4 hrs when the sample collector finally arrived . And again reports had not been received and we have been waiting for 40hrs while they said it would be delivered within 24hrs. Again I had to call multiple times to the customer support and multiple tickets raised on app but no response . The customer service is not to the mark and app also is useless .,"Improve sample collection timing, ensure timely deliveryof reports, enhance customer service and app functionality"
Worst app. I have shared all my concerns with the support team.,Address customer concerns and improve app functionality
Gave a simple ketone test samples. First time got rejected after 3 days and they asked for resample. I gave 2 samples second time and again the sample got rejected after 2 days saying they are getting the result as invalid qnd asking for resample 3rd time. I think they don't know hownto do a simple ketone test. Last week I gave blood samples for full body checkup and got the result in a day but I doubt if those reports are reliable. Not helpful for emergency.,"Improve accuracy and reliability of ketone test, provide timely and reliable reports for full body checkup"
"Packages are priced reasonably. But if you open their app, add in the cart but don't place the order, the marketing guys call you continuously and chase you to book the order, lacking sensitivity and courtesy. When I told one of them that I don't need to place the order now, he slammed the phone. Very unprofessional guys. Response to Healthian team: Please read my review. I have not placed the order and so your team chased me to order it being very pushy.","Improve marketing and customer service approach, train staff to be more professional and courteous"
"Very bad experience. They took the booking for sample collection, took money but after that no one showed up for sample collection. Even I got no message after that. I cancel the booking but didn't get the refund. wasted my time for booking, contacting with customer care. I have booked the test for my father. He also suffered a lot as he have to be in fasting for 10-12 hours. Not recommend at all. I request everyone not to book any test from this app..so that, you don't have to suffer as I suffer.","Ensure sample collection after booking, provide timely refund, improve customer care support"
They are quick to book appointment to collect sample. They do not give report on time. 3days they say but ...... If you try to pess 8 on IVR and try to connect for report related queries you will spend 20 mins may be more without getting connected..... If you connect on IVR to book an appointment your call will be connected instantaneously. ****People will remember who did what at these times of need.****,"Improve timeliness of report delivery, enhance IVR system for better customer support"
I have been using this from past 6 months for all my family members. These guys are awesome. The packages they offer with such competitive prices. Never found in any other application.. What I really liked is your report gets updated real-time on the link they provide. Instead of waiting for the complete report till next day. It gets updated whenever it's done in the backend..,Continue offering competitive prices and real-time report updates
"I used to normally book my thyroid and order basic pathology tests through thyrocare, but somehow I didn't like the experience after so many years.. But Healthians really did an amazing job from the booking to the person arriving for the blood samples, the blood report and the consultation.. couldn't ask for more from a pathology company. Amazing experience Healthians can surely look forward for my support with blood tests or any other service they provide in the future.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",Provide excellent service from booking to consultation for various tests
Looks like this people don't maintain any record of their customers. I talked with one of their customer executive today. but still this called me like 20times again and again. This is so irritating. even i got call at 8:30 am. so annoying.,Improve customer record management and avoid unnecessary repeated calls

"My experience with healthians was extremely smooth and timely. Not sure why others have experienced the opposite but, I've gotten an RTPCR test done twice in the span of 2 weeks without any issues. Great job healthians! But please improve your customer service and look into the matter of the individuals who have had issues.","Ensure smooth and timely testing process, improve customer service, address issues faced by some individuals"
Getting the patho tests sitting at home is made pleasant by this app. Collection of sample at home is very hygienic and professionally managed. The sample collector is very helpful and knows his job.

"Such a bad customer service! I'd booked an appointment for home collection for RT PCR test for my dad. I paid online and received a confirmation that the sample would be collected at 1.30pm today. Nobody came for sample collection, and nobody even contacted us that it would be delayed. I'm not able to connect with the customer care, they've kept me on hold for the last 45 mins! Seriously if you cannot offer home collection just state it priorly so that people can arrange it from somewhere else!","Improve customer service and communication, ensure timely sample collection for home appointments"
If you cancel a booking chase them for refund else they will happily keep that money. I got my money after 7 weeks when k suddenly recalled that I had cancelled my booking. Worst is they make you enter bank account details for claiming refund.. why can't refund be done simply to same mode of payment. Never using this app again. Trust breakers!!,"Streamline refund process, enable refund to the same mode of payment, regain customer trust"
"Worst app! You need to have better booking system. My booking was automatically rescheduled after making payment and sample collection then get personal message from the collection exec that make the payment again or we won't run the tests. It is for my 7-year-old daughter. Pathetic customer support, if you inquire they call you 10 times but when you need help they have no number only email address and will not call even after requesting a call back. Do Not use them and go for reliable labs.","Improve booking system, provide better customer support, address issues promptly"
