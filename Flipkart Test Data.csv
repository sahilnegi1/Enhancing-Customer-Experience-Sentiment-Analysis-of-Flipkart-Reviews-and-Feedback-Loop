"I can't see images after the video you put on the 3-4th slide, it doesn't just move, I can't understand how things will look specially something that needs to be worn. It's very disturbing, this feature is really pissing me off, I had to return things bcz those doesn't fit well, bcz I couldn't see the preview. Please work on it. Also, packaging has improved for Flipkart over time, but would love to see further progress, instead of plastic tapes/packets use something else."
"Even if we connect it to a wifi of high speed it takes forever to load and show the result. It is really very frustrating to wait for it to load everytime we change the screen. I request you to kindly look into this matter and fix this issue and if it is fixed it is an excellent app. However, this issue makes it the worst until it is fixed."
"Flipkart's app has become increasingly buggy with each update. Existing features are glitchy, and new ones only add to the problems. Despite user feedback, the developers seem unresponsive, leaving us with an app that's hard to use. Frequent crashes, slow loading, unrecognisable writings and unresponsive buttons make it a frustrating experience. Hope for a bug-free app soon. Can't recommend it in the current state."
"Even if i connect it to a high speed wifi it takes forever to load and show the result and most of the time it says something went wrong. I wanted to purchase books from flipkart but if this keeps happening then it will difficult to do it.I request you to kindly look into this matter and fix this issue and if it is fixed it is an excellent app. However, this issue makes it the worst until it is fixed."
"This is such a Great App, I have Completely fallen in love with it. High quality products at low prices! However, I would like to suggest some improvements. They should have size charts [measurements] for each product as sizes sometimes vary according to brands so it is difficult to choose a size based only on MSP Also there should be an option to Cancel (not at the time of delivery but when the order is being dispatched ....??????"
"Questionable UX choices. I know you have new features on left/right swipe, don't shove them in my face when I'm looking for something on my current tab. Instead show me that I can swipe, but without cutting any content on my main focus page. Plus, once I've seen the hint, do not show it to me ever again, it's super irritating and makes me want to go to Amazon's dated but less irritating UI."
"Flipkart is my primary shopping app. The customer support, delivery experience and quality of products, everything has been good for so long. But since a few days, there has been a compromise in the quality of the products. Also, some of the products now have 3 days return period which is quite unconvinient. Also, there has been a frequent mix-up of the products. I have received different product from what I ordered THRICE this year. It'a good platform but these things need to be improved."
"Flipkart was so good before, the products I used to receive were exactly like the ones shown in the app but recently all the products i have received were either damaged, had a hole in it or they were not like the ones shown in the app. I even received items that were totally different. The colours,the designs everything. In the past few months nothing i have received was perfect. I hope you'll improve this. I'm highly disappointed."
"The most fraudulent service I have ever seen. If the item is paid as Cash on Delivery that time it may reach. But if paid earlier, then getting that item is not possible. I had the worst experience on that. I ordered an item, shared 3 contact no.'s. But without contacting any no. out of those 3, item showed as delivered. 4 times I raised complaint, but all were fruitless. Within 1 or 2 days the issue will show as resolved without contacting. My opinion, either quit this rubbish app else only COD"
"Everytime it says it can't ship to my pincode almost all the time. It is so annoying! And I have placed an order for a mobile and the delivery date kept on delaying and got cancelled second time during bbd sale the same thing is repeating the delivery date has been changed twice and second time it doesn't even give any update. Disgusting app, I just want to uninstall it after I receive my products or just cancel all the orders!!!"
Reducing one star as over the past few there seems to be a bug in product page and hasn't been resolved yet. I can't scroll the product images after the 3rd image even if there are 9 or 10 inages and videos. I tried magnifying the product and then scrolling still no use. Hope you guys fix it. Love the new features but if the base functionalities don't work then that's an issue.
"The Flipkart app's delivery service left me incredibly disappointed. My order was delayed without any clear communication, and when it arrived, the packaging was in terrible condition, leading to a damaged product. Trying to resolve the issue was even worse – their customer support was unhelpful and seemed indifferent to my concerns. Dealing with them was a frustrating experience, and I won't be using their app again."
"Recently they\'ve added Rs 10 for orders that are available in great offers claiming as ""one time sale fee"". It\'s almost the same amount which we are using super coins to reduce the final amount. This seems unnecessary and is there for almost all items I\'ve ordered recently. Disappointed. Old review: I\'ve ordered almost 10 items from flipkart at a stretch and I\'m Happy with my shopping with flipkart. .delivery done as promised ! and easy returns or replacements and value for money !"
I never thought I would give 1 rating for this app because it is the only online shopping I was using and I'm a plus member but from last one week all the products are showing as non deliverable for my location and I'm really not sure what's the issue. If it is one or two products I can understand that it's seller not delivering but all the products are showing non deliverable. I think I'm gonna completely uninstall this app because there is no use of keeping it when they can't deliver things.
"I have been buying books from this app since years. Recently I ordered a book worth 1832 INR on this app. Not only did they take a hell lot of time to deliver (more than 10 days) but also they gave me some cheap small book instead of the one I ordered. When I filed a return and refund, they say that they take 3 working days just for someone to pick up the wrong product delivered to me. To add to that I must fall within their rigid return policy. They wouldn't paid me for the lost time even."
"Placed an order on 1 October and I was supposed to get my item on 11th. On the day of delivery, the app decided to cancel my order by itself. When I tried to call the delivery agent, someone else picked up. Flipkart don't even provide you with the right phone number of the delivery agent. The experience was so bad, you are better off walking to the store and buying it from there."
"Fraudulent marketing. They hide one or two digits from real price while showing in app, after adding to cart, the price will be at least 10 times of what you expected. Be very careful before you pay. Refund process is not reliable. if they give you a giftcard, the card is not usable. you can just see a card in the app. you cannot use it."
The app is having a lot of issues these past few months. I have been using Flipkart for years but the amount of issues that I faced in these months are more than that of the past years. Also for every product it shows not deliverable and some product not delivered to promise time. this issue is from past 2-3 months.
"I'm extremely disappointed with the delivery service from Flipkart. My order was scheduled for delivery twice, but both times it was not delivered. The lack of effective communication and support from their customer service only added to my frustration. It's essential for a company to provide reliable delivery and responsive customer service, and Flipkart has fallen short in both aspects. I hope they take immediate steps to rectify these issues. Wish I could give less than 1 star"
"All features are good except the chat feature to deal with any orders. When by mistakenly if i click on ""cancel my order"", without even the double confirmation, the chatbot directly cancelled my order!! Very bad Flipkart.... I have lost 2k discount offer because of this mistaken cancellation. I immediately called the customer care number as well, them mentioned that refund is already processed within just 2mins.... Please ask for double confirmation before cancellation of any order ??"
App is having lot of issues recently. Some features are not stable. Price shown is varying on clicking on the product. Delivery also getting delayed these times. There were no wide range of products compared to earlier.
There is no contol of flipcart on their registered sellers. Recently I have placed an order but at the time of delivery seller cancelled my order. I was eagerly waiting for my order but because of the pathetic services given by Flipcart I'm really disappointed. I will never recommend anyone to shop on flipcart. Local venders are better than the flipcart.
"It's tha worst shopping application ever. Regularly I pay the pay later money, only for 1 month I have some issue so that I was pay tha bill little bit lately. But that flipkart now block the pay later option for my account. And not showing the product cancel option. It's too cheap and mean.. Shame on you flipkart."
"I don\'t know why in my orders you ware showing ""Order Not Placed"". If I placed an order if it\'s successful then only you should show it in my orders. Some times if I try to check total price and offer and get back then also it showing in my orders earlier it was not like this if I placed order or cancelled then Flipkart ware showing in my orders. Sometimes it is irritating to see red line ""Order Not Placed"" for this product. Remove this feature from the app. Other than this app is really good.'"
Tonight on this platform i was about to make a big purchase. It has na extra discount using super coins. But i couldn't use it how much ever i tried. Tried calling customer care also but they too couldn't help. I didn't purchase aa the supercoin discount was a deal breaker. Whats the point of having such a n important feature if you won't let use use it??? Anyways thank you Flipkart for helping me save money ????
Worst experience with the Flipkart.. I'm using the app from past few years..but these days they are accepting the order and they have deducted the amount from my account and they are not delivering the product... after few days they are cancelling the orders..they don't even inform you about the cancellation and they don't even have the hub details with them if you want to talk to directly with the hub members.
"Not a bad app . This should not put a fine on its customers while returning . Instead they should charge those developers or those who market their product by enhancing product color n pattern. I got an open box delivery , it was not my choice to get the item through open box delivery, but it was the app's choice to deliver the item like that n the app or the delivery agent could notify me bout it n things related to it. Now the hell m stock with a bad product. ??"
"The worst app I've ever experienced. First, neither the app works, nor does it work from web browser. Secondly there's no provision to add mobile number if the account is registered with email ID, or viceversa. Then this app has extremely poor refund policy. Options are too limited and ineffective that can be good alibi to compel the buyers not to return ever any item purchased. It sends OTP for everything without any provision to enter the OTP, then the account gets locked. Worst & illegitimate"
Worst app for flight booking. It is almost 7 months since I raised the issue but zero effort by their support team to get it resolved. They were unhelpful in resolving my issue and failed to provide any meaningful assistance. It was a frustrating and disappointing encounter that left me questioning the overall competence and dedication of their support staff.
"Disgusting. I would like to return the Realme Neckband 3 that I bought on October 8 since I am not happy with the audio quality, the power on/off settings are confusing, and FLIPKART is not letting me return it. They are not ready to accept it back yet, despite offering the return option. Flipkart - kindly do the needful to return such a bad quality product."
"Very bad experience with flipkart.. I had this Flipkart Pay later limit of 90,000 but when I wanted to use this option for buying products for my sister's marriage, I couldn't use it at all . Not a single product was accepting Pay later option ! Contacted customer care twice but they didn't solve this issue of mine ! Horrible experience and I am very disappointed with the app. Amazon on the other hand offers the same Pay later option and it is so perfect! Thanks Amazon ??"
"Loading time is very high in this app , Even if you have a good connection, it takes time which is really frustrating and today I face an issue in making the payment, the application has a lot of bugs. 1.Items added to cart may sometimes not be ordered together. 2.Pay button freezes after entering credit card/debit card details For this reason I am not able to make credit or debit card payments. 3.Order history does not open sometimes. Your Sincerely Plus Customer"
The app is having a lot of issues these past few months. I have been using Flipkart for years but the amount of issues that I faced in these months are more than that of the past years. Also for every product it shows not deliverable and this issue is from past 2-3 months.
"This is such a terrible experience with Flipkart app. It has become too much slowz unresponsive and laggy. Moreover I can't even edit my wishlist anymore. Every time I add new product or delete anything from wishlist, again it becomes same as it was. Meaning no changes to list. Product deleted shows back and any new addition doesn't get added."
"In this app they fool customer by showing fake offers which they never give and custom series response is very bad. Want to give negative star. Most of the times items are missing in order delivered. They you have to call customer care & waste 30 mins and then have to return the order which we had ordered as we needed. The bigger headache is, the pick up person asks for the missing item in the order. Also the review on products are fake. They don't publish genuine reviews."
"One of the worst d2c brands in India, especially in customer convince and journey. On the other had there biggest competitor is the best company when it comes to customer satisfaction. I am a customer since 2013, and every time I order there is always an issue either with delivery or with the product itself. Such a trash of a company. I wanted to give negative 5 Star, unfortunately there is no option for that."
Worst services by any Ecom company. My last 2 order was delayed for long time and due to that only I have cancelled my 1 order and till now I am unable to track my second order as well. It was about to be delivered on 22nd September but till now it is showing in transit only. I am using multiple online shopping apps but this is the worst experience I have ever faced. I tried to connect with chat multiple times but not getting proper response.
"The worst app ever. When I ordered i was able to order and then they informed me the time the order will be delivered. But after few days they canceled my order by saying it is out of stock. Why the app didn't show me in the first place. I tried to speak with the customer care they just saying order with some other retailer. But I can't get the discount which I got for my order now as the price has increased. Who will pay the extra price. The worst customer care, unworthy to install this app."
"This is a worst experience I had with flipkart. I have ordered one mobile and made that payment through credit card. Now they have cancelled without notice and they said it's a technical error. My question is who will pay the bank interest amount and processing fees that the bank have charged at the time of my order.It's costs around Rs 1000,????????"
